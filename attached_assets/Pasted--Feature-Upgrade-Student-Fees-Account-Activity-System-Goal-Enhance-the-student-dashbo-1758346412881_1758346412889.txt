🔧 *Feature Upgrade: Student Fees & Account Activity System*

🎯 *Goal:*
Enhance the student dashboard to fully reflect their *fees, payment history, account status, and activity logs*, and implement *term-aware* calculations & scholarship logic.



✅ 1. *Sync Student Fees with Admin Records*

*Task:*
* Pull student-specific fees, balances, and payment data from the *admin fees page* or database.
* Reuse or adapt code from the *student records page* to get accurate fee entries.
* Show:
  - *Amount paid*
  - *Balance remaining*
  - *Current status* (`Paid`, `Partially Paid`, `Not Paid`)
  - *Term* (see below)
  - *Scholarship flag*

✅ 2. *Implement Term System Logic*

*Terms Definition:*
* *Term 1:* Jan – April  
* *Term 2:* May – Aug  
* *Term 3:* Sept – Dec

*Implementation:*
* Auto-detect current term using system date.
* Show fee records *categorized by term*.

✅ 3. *Payment History Section*

* Display:
  - *All past payments*
  - *Date & time*
  - *Amount paid*
  - *Payment method (if tracked)*
  - *Reference/transaction ID*
* Group payments by term for clarity.

✅ 4. *Scholarship-Aware Access to Results*

* If student is under a *full scholarship*:
  - Allow them to *access results even with zero personal payment*.
  -  admin to *tag student as scholarship-sponsored*
    - e.g., `scholarship: true`, `scholarship_type: full`
* For partial scholarships, apply normal rules.
